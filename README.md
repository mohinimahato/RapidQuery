### 1. Chat Section üí¨
Engage in seamless communication through our desktop-designed chat section, where users can effortlessly ask their questions.

### 2. Chat Bubble with Voting Property üîçüëç
Each desktop-friendly chat bubble is equipped with a dynamic voting property, allowing users to express their support for specific queries. Here's how it works:

   - **Moderate Priority Section:** Questions receiving more than 3 votes seamlessly transition to the moderate priority section. This ensures that important queries gain visibility and attention.

   - **High Priority Section:** Questions with more than 3 votes ascend to the high priority section, signaling their critical nature. These questions demand immediate attention and resolution.

Both priority sections provide a convenient "Dismiss" button. Simply click it to mark the question as resolved, streamlining the process of managing and addressing queries efficiently.
